        <h2>Werther</h2>
        <p>
            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole
            heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
            mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
            I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
            artist than now.
        </p>
        <p>
            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
            foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the
            tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
            me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable
            forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and
            the breath.

        <h2>Cicero</h2>
        <p>
            No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
            pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
            in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
            it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
            that they cannot foresee.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you
            a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
            of human happiness.

        <h2>Kafka</h2>
        <p>
            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
            He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
            and divided by arches into stiff sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of
            textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture
            that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
            fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
            lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared
            with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought.
            It wasn't a dream.
